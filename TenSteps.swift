                            "Go all out for recovery",
                            "Motion is life",
                            "Set goals for recovery",
                            "Take ownership of your journey",
                            "Establish a lifeline",
                            "Mobilize all resouces",
                            "Rally your social support",

    let arrayOfStepSummary = ["Move from a mindset of being a victim to one of being a survivor. What can you do? Listen to music;writing;talk to your facilitator; other ways of expressing your concerns",
                              "Replace avoidable stressors with positive elf-talk - this encourages positive behaviors. Mind-body activities (breathing exercise meditation, coloring, physical activity, and reading) may reduce the negative experience of post-traumatic stresses.",
                              "Choose to invest your energy in your recovery. Follow directions of doctors, nurses and therapists; fully participate in your recovery and exercise activities. Movement leads to independence, so any forward step is helping you get back to your activities",
                              "Incorporate movement into each day; move all body parts where possible to keep your strength. Think about all you CAN do at the time. Be safe when you move about. The presence of pain when healing is normal - however, pain should not increase during or after your activity. Each person has a different recovery timeline, remember to celebrate any progress",
                              "Set short-term goals(daily, over the net couple days, weeks) and long-term goals(months to a year) that are important to you",
                              "Seize this chance to take control of your recovery progress by being engaged in your care. Ask questions, know what medications you are on and why, and what procedures are being done and why.",
                              "Recovery will have up and down days. Who is a non-family friend who you can talk to when you have a rough day? Are you interested in contact with another person who has had similar experiences as you? Ask your facilitator.",
                              "Create a plan of your needs and concerns that can help with emotional support, transportation, food and medicine, family care roles, access in the home, pet or child care, or family caretaker roles. Develop a contact list and resources that you can take with you as you go forward.",
                              "Bring your family and friends together to go forward positively. Faith-based support is available in the hospital and in the community. Use social media to help you hear from others while you recover",
                              "Be patient with yourself as you adapt to your new 'normal'. Health lifestyle choices(good nutrition, quality sleep, physical movement) and social participation can help you feel more in control of your life"]
